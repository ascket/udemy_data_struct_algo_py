# Materials of the course 'Udemy Data Structures & Algorithms - Python' by Scott Barrett
This is one of the easiest to understand yet powerful courses on algorithms. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand algorithms and prepare for the coding interview. [Link to the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/)
